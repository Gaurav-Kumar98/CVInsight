Error Handling Improvements:
Add more robust error handling in the LLM service, especially for API rate limits and timeouts.
Implement retries with exponential backoff for API calls to handle temporary failures.
Code Structure Optimization:
Create a dedicated Resume class that encapsulates all the extracted information instead of merging dictionaries in process_resume().
Implement a ResumeProcessor class to separate the processing logic from the main script.
Performance Enhancements:
The concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor is used effectively, but could benefit from adjustable thread pool sizes based on system resources.
Consider caching common LLM queries to reduce API usage and improve performance.
Configuration Management:
Move hardcoded values like "./Resumes" and "./Results" to the config.py file for centralized configuration.
Implement different configuration profiles (development, production) with appropriate settings.
Validation & Data Quality:
Add input validation for the extracted resume text before sending to LLM.
Implement post-processing validation of extracted data to ensure correctness.
Add data normalization for dates, phone numbers, and other structured fields.
Extensibility:
Create a plugin system for extractors to make it easier to add new extractors.
Add support for different resume formats (not just PDF).
Documentation:
Add docstrings to all functions, especially in utility modules.
Create comprehensive user documentation with examples.
Add type hints consistently throughout the codebase.
Testing:
Add unit tests for each extractor and utility function.
Implement integration tests for the complete workflow.
Add mock LLM responses for testing without API calls.
Logging Improvements:
Implement structured logging for better analysis.
Add log rotation to prevent log files from growing too large.
Consider adding telemetry for monitoring system performance.
Security Enhancements:
Add input sanitization before processing any file.
Implement proper handling of sensitive information in extracted data.
Add rate limiting to prevent abuse if exposed as a service.
User Experience:
Add a command-line interface with options (using argparse or click).
Implement progress reporting during processing.
Add detailed statistics about processing results.
Dependencies Management:
Specify version numbers in requirements.txt for better reproducibility.
Consider using a dependency manager like Poetry for better dependency management.
LLM Prompt Engineering:
Review and optimize prompts for each extractor to improve extraction accuracy.
Experiment with different prompt formats and instructions.
Add examples in prompts for better zero-shot learning.
Code Duplication:
There seems to be similar code in each extractor. Consider refactoring common patterns.
Output Format Options:
Support multiple output formats beyond JSON (CSV, XML, etc.).
Add an option for human-readable output summaries.
Modernize PDF Processing:
Consider using more modern PDF libraries that handle complex layouts better.
